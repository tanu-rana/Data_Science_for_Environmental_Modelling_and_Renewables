```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source("../theme/theme-mooc.R")
```

We start by loading the data and create a plot of the water flow.
```{r, flcolours=TRUE}
load("../../data/week3/nile.RData")
plot(nile_flow, xlab="Year", ylab=expression("Flow [10"^9*m^3*"]"))
```

We next fit a changepoint model looking for changepoints in the mean.
```{r, flcolours=TRUE}
library(changepoint)
plot(cpt.mean(nile_flow, method="PELT"), xlab="Year", ylab=expression("Flow [10"^9*m^3*"]"))
```

This is not very useful, as we are interested in changes to the slope rather than changes in the mean (a linear trend means constant changes to the mean).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)                    # Setting seed for reproducability
```

The R package `segmented` allows us to fit piece-wise linear models. 
```{r, flcolours=TRUE}
library(segmented)
# The function segmented needs the data in a data frame, rather than a ts object
nile <- data.frame(year=1871:1984, flow=nile_flow)
# The function segmented needs some initial guesses of when the changepoint were
model <- segmented(lm(flow~year, data=nile), seg=~year, psi=c(1900,1930,1960))
plot(nile, xlab="Year", ylab=expression("Flow [10"^9*m^3*"]"), type="l")
plot(model, add=TRUE, col=2, lwd=2)
title("Model assuming changes in slope")
summary(model)
```
