## R 

R is a command-based language. This means you get R to do something by entering commands like
```{r}
# Create a few variables (which can be a function of an)
variable <- "I want to learn R"              
another_variable <- 24
yet_another_variable <- sqrt(another_variable*6)
# Print the value of one of the variables
yet_another_variable
```
In some way R is nothing than a very fancy calculator. There aren't just the functions like the square root, which you would find on a calculator, there are also more complex functions for things like fitting models or visualising data.

If you are using a front-end like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), it is typically easier if you enter the commands into the code editor and then run these commands. 

## Extension packages
R already has a lot of functionality built in, but there are now more than 13,000 extension packages, available at 

## Cheat sheets
RStudio have put together a very helpful collection of [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). They are not aimed at first-time users, but are the perfect tool if you don't remember the name of a function or a function argument.

## Working with data in R

The easiest way of getting data into R is to use text files, such as `.csv` files, though you can also connect to [databases](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/), read in more specialised file formats such  as [XML](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xml2) or [netcdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ncdf4/).
